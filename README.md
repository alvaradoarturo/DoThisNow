# DoThisNow
This is a Java-based to-do list application that allows users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete, and the list can be saved to a file for persistence. The project focuses on core Java concepts like object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interaction.

To improve flexibility and maintainability, the Builder Pattern is used to create task objects. This allows for a clean and scalable way to construct tasks with optional attributes like due dates, priority levels, and categories without requiring multiple constructors.
